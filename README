KRENN - diagrams

krenn diagrams are a way to visualize (and possibly navigate) a certain class of data. 
appropriate data:
    - symmetric connected vertices of a graph.
    - items tagged with (partly) overlaying tags

Usage:
only svg:
load krenn.svg in the browser

in a html-file:
load test_krenn.html to you're browser

Configuration:
1. modify the configuration section of krenn.svg
2. modify the source-code which is quite straight-forward
