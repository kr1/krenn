KRENN - diagrams

1. WHAT IS KRENN?
    krenn diagrams are a way to visualize (and navigate) data. It works best for a certain classes of data:
 
    appropriate data:
        - a (very) limited number of symmetric connected vertices of a graph (also with weighed distances).
        - items tagged with (partly) overlaying tags


2. Usage/Example:
    example for plain svg:
    load krenn.svg in the browser

    svg embedded in a html-file:
    load test_krenn.html to you're browser


3. Configuration:

3.1. diagram types:
    there are currently 3 types of diagrams:
    3.1.1 type="flower":
       around a centerfield there are the connected fields.
       <img src="http://github.com/kr1/krenn/raw/master/static/flower_type.png"/>

    3.1.2 type="flagpole"
        from the vertical centerfield on the right the connected fields overlay and continue to the right (overlays are proportional to the weight of the connection)

    3.1.3 type="shelve"
         between 2 vertical centerfields there are the horizontal connected field (overlays are proportional to the weight of the connection) 

3.2. navigation (link-) configurations
    there are 2 types of mapping between the elements of the diagram
    3.2.1. hash-based mapping
        a supplied hash with the ID as key and the link-target as value will connect clicks and URLs

    3.2.2. function-based mapping
        if you supply a function that uses the ID and produces a URL it will be hooked up to the click-event

3.3. other configurations
    1. modify the configuration section of krenn.svg (dimensions, colors, transparency)
    2. modify the source-code which is quite straight-forward
